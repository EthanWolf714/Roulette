## README

Hello! And welcome to our Roulette Game, it is incomplete as of this moment. We spent a good time trying to figure things out, but just ran out of time when we tried to do all these images. Things just didn't work out the way we intended with all of our other assignments and schedules being filled to the brim from OPL and Formal Languages for the most of us. There were just a lot of projects to do, and not a lot of time to actually sit down and complete them all in the way we intended.

However we're here to explain why we did, what we did. 

Luke, the man behind the Chip and rouletteColor decided to actually split up the rouletteColor pretty easily into numerous subclasses. That way we could gather the actual multipliers for numbers and retrieve what kind of number they were then actually implement it into the game. This allowed us to actually be able to find what the number was for a bet, and if the player actually betted. If we had gotten the betting board fully one to one, which was one of our largest difficulties. Which is why it looks so incomplete. Another thing that Luke had really gotten done and truly got to understand was the Chip which was a lot easier of a class. It was just an additional circle that would look upon the bets and actually add to it. It allows us to just put down the chips and change their colors depending on the bed.

Ethan, the man behind the rouletteBall and the bettingBoard. This man also worked a fair bit on the controller. We decided that we didn't necessarily need rouletteBall as a class, or at least we didn't think we would need it at the time. The bettingBoard, we couldn't complete due to work and various other issues. We tried to find the time to actually work on it together, but we ran into issues. So we weren't able to actually talk about what all the cases would return. However, since we couldn't even get the UI to work, we we're more or less focused on that.

Zach, the man behind the View and Wheel. This man worked primarily on trying to get the UI to work majorly. The main issue that came to my work was the fact of us trying to use images rather than making everything from scratch ourself. We had the goal to make it look more like what websites use, but because of that. We had to work with the large issues of bounds. Bounds for some strange reason would just not work properly. The Wheel however worked wonderfully as it intended as a class in the backend sort of idea where it would represent the idea of things being moved around.

The Controller, the root of all of our evils. This is where most of our issues laid because of placing bets, and the actual spinning of the ball. For some reason, we kept running into issues with the bounds that we couldn't work out. You'll see that the ball completely goes off axis and when you try to place inside the betting board. The X and Y is just completely wrong and all of our positioning is just wrong. That's an issue with the View and my work. I knew that would be an issue, and we started to realize way too late that the images were our main issue. Due to the onslaught of assignments we had during deadweek and over break, we completely lost the ability to properly attack this. Even before deadweek when we tried working on it.

# THE MAIN KNOWN BUGS:
- Currently a massive issue with the Ball rotating along the wrong axis
- Issue with Bets not being fully ready.
- The betting boards positioning just being completely off.
- Some unfinished code.
- No clear distinction between chips and ball visually. (Colors were off.)

## Debugging Collaborators
https://github.com/robrichardson27/Roulette-Game-Javafx/tree/master - Our main collaborator, we needed an idea of what to base on, but we didn't want to copy it. We wanted to make something original, and ended up backing us into a corner.
